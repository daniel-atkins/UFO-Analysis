# UFO-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a local table of UFO sightings with their relevant details, and to make this table searchable by those details.

## Results
The use of this webpage is relatively straightforward. The user can search by any of the below filters and any UFO sightings with matching details will be returned:

## Summary

In my view, there is one key issue with this project - that the database is local. Ideally one would have a distributed network cataloging all UFO sightings, so that none were missed and new sightings could be added.

To improve upon this, one could create an automated webscraper to pull information of all new UFO sightings and have it added to the database. Additionally, one could expand upon the level of detail & filters to enhance the usability of the website.
